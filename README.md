# Project Rakshak Drone
## Introduction
Using Rakshak drone we tend to develope an efficient network of ***autonomous drones*** that are capable of executing tasks
like ***disinfecting places from air, where two or more people are found walking close to each other***  
### ðŸ”­ &nbsp; About this Project
Real-time monitoring from the control centre is enabled by a video camera and streaming system installed on the drones and automatically sanitising the crowded area with the help of machine learning and persons detection. Outdoor drones are deployed to disinfect hospital buildings, benches, car parking areas and public community spaces, while smaller indoor drones installed with portable UVC lights, can be used to disinfect indoor surfaces of hospitals and other public buildings.

### ðŸ’¼ &nbsp; Working
Drones will be set in the public places for the surveillance of crowd to ensure that all the safety  guidelines for pandemic like covid are followed properly. If many people are not walking 6 feet apart then drone will detect the coordinates and sanitise the area from above spray.
